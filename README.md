# Antiverse Mod

See [description](description.txt)

## Building

Requires .NET Core SDK 6, Terraria 1.4+ & tModLoader for 1.4+ are installed

To build, place in Mod Sources directory (on Linux, "~/.local/share/Terraria/tModLoader/Mod Sources") and run `dotnet build` or open tModLoader and go into Workshop -> Develop Mods and press Build + Reload on AntiverseMod

## Planned Content

### Pre-Hardmode

- [X] Stone idol - Early game magic weapon (from stone + fallen star at work bench)
- [X] Scrap sword (from all types of pre-hardmode metals at work bench)
- [X] Placeable Demonic/Crimson altars (from vertebrae/rotten chunk + crimstone/ebonstone + vile/vicious powder at work bench)

#### Post-Queen Bee

- [X] Demolitionist now sells beenades when holding beenades and in jungle

#### Post-EoW/BoC

- [X] Sassolite & boron (sassolite from extractinating ash, boron from sassolite + iron/lead at hellforge)
- [X] Fungicide powder (from sassolite at bottle)
- [ ] Reinforced glass (from boron + glass at glass kiln)
- [ ] Usage of reinforced glass to make fibreglass fishing pole (change recipe) and glass armour (at glass kiln)
- [ ] Boron armour or shielding accessory for immunity or resistance to radiation from uranium ore

### Hardmode

- [X] Necromantic Mirror - Teleportation to death point (breaks on use; configurable) (from magic/ice mirror + souls of night + souls of light + bones)
- [X] Killer beenade (from beenade + titanium/adamantite)

#### Post-Mech

- [ ] Circuitry (from mechanical bosses)
- [ ] Engineer's Workstation crafting station (from circuitry + titanium/adamantite + cogs + wire + work bench)
- *Need some uses for circuitry*

#### Post-Plantera

- [X] Temple key mold replaces Temple Key from plantera's drop pool
- [X] Temple key is crafted from temple key mold + soul of fright + soul of sight + soul of might + ectoplasm
- *Maybe we want some content in the dungeon seeing as we're shepherding players there...?*


- [X] Shroomite Arrow (from Shroomite at mythril anvil)
- [X] Shroomite Bullet (from Shroomite at mythril anvil)


- [ ] Biomechanics (from circuitry + cogs + chlorophyte at Engineer's Workstation)
- *Need some uses for biomechanics... It also needs to be made post-plantera... or it could be removed*

#### Post-Golem

- [X] HL2-inspired Gravity Gun (Zero-Point Energy Field Manipulator) dropped by Golem in master mode


- [ ] Advanced circuitry (from martians or crafted from circuitry and martian conduit plating/another material)
- *Maybe an advanced version of the Engineer's Workstation? Or maybe that station is made with advanced circuitry seeing as it isn't used before obtaining it*


- [ ] Neodymium (from neodymium ore which spawns at world gen minable with a picksaw from golem)
- [ ] Superstrong magnets (from neodymium + boron + iron/lead at Engineer's Workstation)
- [ ] Superstrong magnet items (Item magnet accessory that increases pickup range, crafted at Engineer's Workstation)
- [ ] Advanced circuitry and superstrong magnet weapons: Railgun for ranged, ??? for other classes: Made from advanced circuitry + superstrong magnet + pre-golem items (e.g. sniper rifle for railgun) at Engineer's Workstation. Essentially upgrades

#### Post-Cultists

- [ ] Nuclear processing facility (from advanced circuitry + titanium/adamantite + reinforced glass + superstrong magnets)
- [ ] Uranium (from uranium ore which spawns at world gen minable with a picksaw. Radioactive in tile form and item form, as well as when in inventory. Need boron or depleted uranium equipment to shield from it)
- [ ] Nuclear waste (radioactive; appears like a barrel and can be placed; From processing uranium in a nuclear processing facility)
- [ ] Depleted uranium (alongside other hardmode metals, extracted from nuclear waste using a chlorophyte extractinator)
- [ ] Depleted uranium armour set with headpiece for each class. Protects from radiation
- [ ] Uranium + depleted uranium weaponry (radioactivity oriented?): bullets & arrows, gamma fusillade-like spellbook, etc.
- *Hang on none of this content is necessarily post-cultists - needs to be post-cultists. Maybe add fragments to NPF recipe*

#### Post-Moonlord

- [ ] Quantum computation chip (from luminite + advanced circuitry at the Engineer's Workstation)
- [ ] Particle accelerator (from quantum computation chip + depleted uranium + gold/platinum + boron + lots of superstrong magnets at Engineer's Workstation)
- [ ] Suspended particles (from glass + superstrong magnet + all of solar/nebula/vortex/stardust fragments)
- [ ] Antimatter (from processing suspended particles in the particle accelerator)
- [ ] Antimatter + superstrong magnets + quantum computation chips equipment
- *Maybe make some way of obtaining luminite without having to repeatedly fight moonlord... or maybe ore duplication with luminite ore + other metal + fragments in the Nuclear processing facility*
